How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

One way that I have found to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is by dividing the project into smaller
pieces. In breaking down the project requirements into smaller, more managable pieces, I can better understand and incorporate the 
requirements into my project. For example, in Project One, I created a CRUD Python module that was later used to connect the dashboard
to the database in Project Two. By breaking down code into smaller pieces, you can write it in a way that it is able to be reused
in the future. Regarding the CRUD Python module that was created in this course, it can be reused in future projects where code is
needed to help create, read, update, or delete elements of a database. 



How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist who is given a project to work on, it is important to ensure that you understand the requirements fully before
beginning your work. Often, I start working on a project and realize halfway through that I have forgotten something or that I am not
following the directions exactly as they are stated. That is why one should ensure that the directions are read and fully understood
as to not make these mistakes. In this course, the templates really helped me make sure that I was on the right track and doing everything
I was supposed to. When approaching the database and dashboard requirements given by Grazioso Salvare, I started on the smaller, easier
portions of the code first, such as declaring my variables or importing my python module. Then, I moved onto the larger issues such as
creating the charts or writing code to modify the database. By getting the smaller tasks out of the way first, it allowed me to focus
my time on the bigger-picture end product.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design and develop programs that help their clients solve problems they are facing. For example, this project for our
client Grazioso Salvare, will help them do their work better in the future because now they can use this dashboard and database connection
to find dogs that are available for adoption that can be used for their organization. They can use the dashboard to filter through the
database and find dogs that can be trained for water or wildnerness rescue, as well as for individual tracking. This dashboard will help
Grazioso Salvare complete their work faster and with ease.
